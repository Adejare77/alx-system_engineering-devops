1. `awk '{a[$1 " " $9]++}`: This part of the command creates an associative array `a` in AWK. The key of the array is formed by concatenating the first column `$1` and the ninth column `$9` with a space in between. For each unique combination of the first and ninth columns, the value of the corresponding key is incremented each time it occurs in the input.

2. `END {for (i in a) print a[i], i | "sort -nr"}`: In the `END` block, we loop through the array `a` using a `for` loop. For each unique combination of the first and ninth columns, we print the occurrence count followed by the concatenated key. The `| "sort -nr"` part pipes the output to the `sort` command with the options `-nr`, which sorts the output numerically and in reverse order, from highest to lowest.

When you run this command, it processes the `apache-access.log` file, counts the occurrences of unique combinations of the first and ninth columns, and then sorts the output by the occurrence count in descending order, as per your requirement.
