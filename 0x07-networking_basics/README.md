Introduction to Networking basics
Open System Interconnection(OSI):- Is a conceptual framework used to describe networking system functions. It helps understand how different networking protocols and technologies interact. OSI is majorly classified as a 7 layered framework while 5 layered framework is also used. The 5 layered framework has no Session nor Presentation layers.
The 7 layered framework are (lowest to highest):
1. Physical layer (cabling, connector, signal type. Ethernet Protocol) uses Hub or Repeater Network device
2. Data link layer (Ethernet Protocol. MAC, LLC) uses Switches or bridges Network device
3. Network layer (Internet Protocol) uses Router
4. Transport layer (UDP and TCP)aornd
5. Session layer
6. Presentation layer
7. Application layer (HTTP protocol)
